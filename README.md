### Loops and more loops

This exercise is to help you get comfortable with loops.

* Make an HTML page with a title and large headline, "Loop Practice" or similar

* Create a script file and connect it to your HTML file.

* Inside the script file, make the following loops:
  
1. Make a loop that counts from 0 to 10.  It should print out in uppercase, "The number is" and each integer, from 0 to 10, in the Console.  Make sure to have the right spacing in the sentence.

2. Make a loop that counts from 5 to 15 in the Console, in multiples of 3.  NOTE: Comment out the code for problem #1 when you run this code.

3. Make a loop that counts by two, from 40 to 60. Alert the results with each integer and then the following text, "little monkeys sitting in a tree" in lowercase. Make sure to have the right spacing in the sentence and add line breaks between lines (add the string "\n" in between each value).

4. Make a loop that counts backwards from 100 to 0, and prints out in the Console. NOTE: Comment out the code from problem #1 and #2 when you run this code.

5. Make a loop that repeats a phrase a certain amount of times. Declare a variable called love and have it be a string that says, "Boston CodeSquad". Use the length of love to determine how many times this phrase should repeat. The phase should say, "I love JavaScript!" repeatedly.

### Bonus: Is it Odd or Even?

Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0 to 25. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.

Your results should look like this:
"0 is even"
"1 is odd"
"2 is even"
......
